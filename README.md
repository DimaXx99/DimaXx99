- 👋 Hi, I’m @DimaXx99
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and get a job as a programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything, but my main focus is to learn backend (Python, Javascript), but I'm also interested in frontend (HTML, CSS3 and Javascript)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me javierhernsant@gmail.com
